Fluid flexible nested grid generator, based on a prototype from Khoa Nguyen (@khoaski) as a base for responsive design.

Current functionality:

set context size (for calculation and max width)
set number of columns
set the gutter size
set the nested level to generate (code might get large easiely - but note HTTP compression (e.g. gzip) available on most servers reduces this dramatically due to the huge redundancy).
custom pre- and postfixes
features as content ordering or comments can be turned on and off to reduce generated css.
